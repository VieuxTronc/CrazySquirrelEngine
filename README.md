# What ? 
Personal project for educational purpose only. 

# Why ? 
Because I love challenges, because graphical programming has always been a mystery for me. 
Because I know nothing about engine programming. 

# How ? 
Tutorial I'm following : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS8wlS9hF8E&list=PLRIWtICgwaX0u7Rf9zkZhLoLuZVfUksDP

# And after the tutorial ? 
After finishing the tutorial, I'll implement my own stuff and have some fun with the engine (Scene management, UI, Serialization). 
I won't make any game, at least in a near future. 
I'll probably use it for making sick fragment / vertex shaders. 

# Current features 
- Logger 
- Basic lightning source 
- Basic reflection 
- Basic transparency 
- Camera 
- .obj parser 
- Flat terrain generation
